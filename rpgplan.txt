**
EffectFunction: A family of classes that accept different inputs/give different outputs based on what they're doing
	there should be a handler method that calls the function and then performs any necessary changes based on the output
	some more specific timings may expect more specific EFs, and have their own handlers for that

EFRecoverHP: (source, user, damage dealt, wasCritical) -> (hp restored)
EFRecoverMP: (source, user, damage dealt, wasCritical) -> (mp restored)
EFAdjustedAccuracyDistance: (source, distance) -> effective distance
EFAdjustedAccuracyDistanceDropoff: (source, distance) -> (accuracy modifier)
EFAdjustedAccuracy: (source, user, target, distanceDropoff) -> (accuracy)
EFAdjustedStatusResistance: (source, user, target) -> (status resistance)
EFAdjustedDefensiveStatTarget: (source, user, target) -> (boolean targetDefense, targets res otherwise)
EFBonusAttack: (source, user, target, incoming damage) -> (list AttackSkillData)
EFApplyStatChange: (source, user, target) -> (void, modifies CombatStats directly)
EFReactiveStatChange (source, user, target, previousStatMap) -> (void, modifies CombatStats directly)
EFSingleAttackStatBonus: (source, user, target) -> (map stat->[isFlat, amount])
EFAttackRepetitions: (source, user) -> (number)
EFReduceIncomingDamage (source, user, target, incoming damage)
EFProtectorsInsight (source, user) -> (boolean; adjusts all weakness/resistance magnitudes)

[[either require input handler, or should be checked by skill selection]]
EFSetParryType (source, user, parryType) -> (void, modifies CombatStats directly)

[second iteration; timing information is encoded in the function type itself, indicates what methods it's expecting]
EffectTiming
	Immediate, TurnEnd, AccuracyCheck, WeaknessResistanceCheck, StatusApplicationCheck, Dodge, OnAttackTarget, OnAttackTargeted, AttackHits, StatChange, WhenHit, AllyAttacked, OnReposition, AttackSkillUsed, onHeal

returns an EFResult with fields that may indicate special actions

EFImmediate: (controller, user, target)
EFBeforeNextAttack: (controller, user, target)
EFAfterNextAttack: (controller, user, target, attackHit, damageDealt, isCritical)
EFWhenAttacked: (controller, target, attacker, attackHit, damageDealt, isCritical)
EFOnStatChange: (controller, user, previousStatMap)
EFOnReposition: (controller, user, target, previousDistance)

EFResult:
	StartBonusAttack (AttackSkillData | None)
	ActionGaugeUsage (float | None)

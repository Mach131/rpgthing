--------------

first maxed class ~level 10, second ~ level 13, third ~ level 15
	equips:
common - always around
uncommon - rarely available around level 2, more common by level 7; expected upgrade around level 4-5
rare - rarely available around level 5, more common by level 13; expected upgrade around level 9
epic - rarely available around level 10, (slightly) more common by level 17; expected upgrade around level 15
legendary - mostly boss drops past level 15; expected upgrade around level 20

EXP per full dungeon run (normally)
	less bonus EXP if too far above a dungeon's recommended level (and most of the dungeon exp comes from the completion bonus, rather than monsters)
level 1: training dungeon gives 5
level 2-4: 20-30
level 5-10: 45-60
level 10-15: 70-85
level 16-20: 100-120

[ending up ~10-15 above these estimates]

	WUPs (weapon upgrade (fruits?)) - currency to enhance weapon rank
	SWUPs (super/sweet) - currency to increase rarity
common: 1/1/1/2/2/2/3/3/3; 10 + 1 SWUP
uncommon: 3/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10; 40 + 5 SWUP
rare: 10/12/14/16/18/20/22/24/26; 100 + 10 SWUP
epic: 30/35/40/45/50/55/60/65/70; 300 + 30 SWUP
leg: 100 + 5S / 125 + 5S / 150 + 10S / 200 + 10S / 250 + 15S / 300 + 15S / 400 + 20S / 500 + 20S / 600 + 25S

To change a trait (cost doubles for every other trait that's already been changed):
common - 1S
uncommon - 3S
rare - 8S
epic - 20S
leg - 50S
[alternative: always costs 10S base, but can only be done after increasing rarity at least once (or if legendary)]


per dungeon run:
level 1-4: 2-5 WUP, expect 1 SWUP in 10 runs
level 5-10: 5-8 WUP, expect 1 SWUP in 5 runs
level 11-15: 8-12 WUP, expect 1 SWUP in 3 runs
level 15-20: 12-15 WUP, 1 SWUP on every boss
endgame: 20-50 WUP, 3-5 SWUP

			Gains a stack for every distance moved while repeating, damage increases based on stacks (later attacks get stronger)
			~7 turn cooldown, staggered with thunder


[use a passive skill to see if health goes below threshold; if it does, reset to 1500, refill action timer, and set some phase flag after doing phase]

		Chain Dash: distance scaling is higher, also gives a charge stack for every 2 distance moved

		Lightspeed Charge 「Power Law」
		75 MP: Taunt attack; locks target on single opponent, can reset if opponent is stunned (from <= 5 turn CD or so)
			Pretty long action time after telegraph; if the target does not hit before next turn, performs a very strong R2 attack + gains 6 charge stacks (even in overdrive)
				if target does attack, does nothing
			~10 turn cooldown, increases by 3 when entering overdrive

-- lv 5-9
all dungeons begin having more enemies, partying likely needed


Beach
	likely to run into magic-using enemies
Swamp
	likely to run into status-using enemies
Abandoned Castle
	likely to run into physically strong enemies
Grasslands
	high enemy variation, longer than usual

Tower
	requires Abandoned Castle clear
	single boss (Clover the Roc); high speed/avoidability, weak to wind and piercing
		repositions quickly upon aggro changing, can act fairly quickly after repositioning

Meadow
	requires Grasslands clear
	duo boss (salali & risuri); mechanics requiring specific positioning relative to each boss
		enrage AOEs if one defeated without the other
	

-- lv 10-14

Graveyard
	enemies with immunities
Desert
	more DOT status conditions
Crime City
	strong ranged enemies hiding behind others
Jungle
	high chance of mixing attack attributes/resistances etc.


Bridge to the World's End
	Kenelm and Avalie boss fight


-- lv 15-20
Mountain
	pretty long
	can lead to several different boss fights
		will + clover + dori
		risuri + salali + nacho
Fight Club
	at most 2 people
	fairly short, but pretty difficult fights
	Fleet boss fight
True Dungeon
	very long, ~3 checkpoints with special rewards
	has some boss-tier fights that can appear as enemies randomly
Seafloor Cavern


Gische Islands
	Irae boss fights - Doom status effect (high damage when wearing off)
Space
	Requires Mountain clear
	Hermes boss fight (w/ automatic defense system)

-- special

Queen's Invitation
	Lv 20, solo only, single room
	Boss fight against Charlotte; all stats very high, can use physical/magic based on lower defense
		Signature skill Astral Charge; negates MP usage for several turns, but temporarily lowers stats and negates skill usage on cooldown
		Range 0 physical, range 1 magic
	20 WUP + 1 SWUP for victory, but can learn Astral Charge as a free skill on first victory

Giles' Legion
	requires Gische Islands clear
	5 rooms, first 3 are standard but strong enemies
	room 4 is mini-boss fight vs vulcan, shubi, sienna, and haihaya; similar roles to player party (physical/magic/support/ranged), but more unique skills
	room 5 is vs giles; has summons to protect him, big FMAs if not countered
	big rewards, like 50 WUP + 5 SWUP + legendary drop chances from rooms 4/5

**
general dungeon rules:
	at the beginning, can choose Formation: move starting position backwards/forwards, at the cost of initial action gauge
	between rooms, can switch equipment but not class/free skills
	restore some % of HP and MP based on dungeon difficulty
special dungeon events:
	Monster House: large enemy team, including a slow tanky spanwer that creates new enemies every turn
		spawned enemies give less exp, but big WUP/SWUP bonus based on haw fast it's cleared
	Golden Slime: ~3 enemies that retreat on their turn, escape if at distance 3; worth lots of exp/WUP/SWUP
	Special Dummy: can appear at the end of a dungeon; deal as much damage as possible within a set time, standard minor boss rewards but keeps a global leaderboard
	Wanted Party: team of opponents with player class skills; generally higher level than dungeon's recommendation, but can drop notably better equips

Queen's Invitation

Giles' Legion
	requires Gische Islands clear
	5 rooms, first 3 are standard but strong enemies
	room 4 is mini-boss fight vs vulcan, shubi, sienna, and haihaya; similar roles to player party (physical/magic/support/ranged), but more unique skills

	big rewards, like 50 WUP + 5 SWUP + legendary drop chances from rooms 4/5

**
general dungeon rules:
	at the beginning, can choose Formation: move starting position backwards/forwards, at the cost of initial action gauge
	between rooms, can switch equipment but not class/free skills
	restore some % of HP and MP based on dungeon difficulty
special dungeon events:
	Monster House: large enemy team, including a slow tanky spanwer that creates new enemies every turn
		spawned enemies give less exp, but big WUP/SWUP bonus based on haw fast it's cleared
	Golden Slime: ~3 enemies that retreat on their turn, escape if at distance 3; worth lots of exp/WUP/SWUP
	Special Dummy: can appear at the end of a dungeon; deal as much damage as possible within a set time, standard minor boss rewards but keeps a global leaderboard
	Wanted Party: team of opponents with player class skills; generally higher level than dungeon's recommendation, but can drop notably better equips

Version 0.1.4

- started tracking version numbers; should hopefully let me do updates without needing to delete characters anymore
- these patch notes and all of the future ones should be accessible in the options menu if i remember to put a google doc link there (/options or ch.options)

__New Content__
- Added a new category of dungeons (Special), currently only containing a training dummy that can report damage done over a given period of time. It's accessible after clearing the Abandoned Storehouse. [todo]

Data for new classes that can be unlocked post-storehouse has been added, but not the ways to unlock them yet; please watch warmly until it is finished

__General__
- probability information now appears in the combat log by default; it's under 'ch.options' if it doesn't automatically change for your or if you want to disable it
- the class selection menu now only shows up to 10 classes at a time; if you have more unlocked, it can be navigated with arrow buttons (similar to equipment menu)

__Combat Systems__
- reduced the initiative penalty from starting at distance 1 or 3 by 40%
- the combat log now indicates when a weakness or resistance is targeted
- increased the maximum display of the combat log before it needs to be expanded (hopefully won't break anything?)
- POISON and BURN should no longer apply damage to defeated enemies

__Equipment__
- in preparation for new classes, some physical weapons now also have small amounts of MAG:
- - Katana
- - Scythe
- - Bolas
- - Longbow
- - Pistol Crossbow

__Enemies__
- attempted to fix a bug that prevents enemies from choosing actions on their turns, soft-locking the dungeon
- rewrote the logic of most AOE attacks to complete in one turn; this should make some effects like status conditions function more intuitively against bosses

Version 0.1.4

-started tracking version numbers; should hopefully let me do updates without needing to delete characters anymore

__General__
- probability information now appears in the combat log by default; it's under 'ch.options' if it doesn't automatically change for your or if you want to disable it
- the class selection menu now only shows up to 10 classes at a time; if you have more unlocked, it can be navigated with arrow buttons (similar to equipment menu)

__Equipment__
- in preparation for new classes, some physical weapons now also have small amounts of MAG:

- - Bolas
- - Longbow

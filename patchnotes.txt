	New Content
Many new dungeons added, primarily for levels 5-10. Clearing certain dungeons will provide access to special content.
	- A PvP arena can be unlocked through one of the earlier post-storehouse dungeons. No balance changes have been made for PvP, and minimal testing has been done for it, but it's there.
Added small tips to the main character info menu.

	General
Fixed a display issue with equipped items that don't have any traits.

	Combat Systems
The Defend action now protects you from all attacks until your next turn, rather than only the next one. In exchange, getting hit while defending only grants 2 MP rather than 3.

	Classes
(+-) Mana Flow (Mage Rank 3): Restored MP is now capped by 10% of max MP, rather than a flat 30.

(-) Battle Frenzy (Mercenary Rank 4): ATK bonus reduced from 10% of missing HP to 5%.

(+-) Serendipity (Wizard Rank 3): Restored MP is now capped by 10% of max MP, rather than a flat 30.

Version 0.1.4b

- started tracking version numbers; should hopefully let me do updates without needing to delete characters anymore
- these patch notes and all of the future ones should be accessible in the options menu if i remember to put a google doc link there (/options or ch.options)

__New Content__
- Added a new category for special dungeons, currently only containing a training dummy that can report damage done over a given period of time. It's accessible after clearing the Abandoned Storehouse.

Data for new classes that can be unlocked post-storehouse has been added, but not the ways to unlock them yet; please watch warmly until it is finished

__General__
- probability information now appears in the combat log by default; it's under 'ch.options' if it doesn't automatically change for your or if you want to disable it
- the class selection menu now only shows up to 10 classes at a time; if you have more unlocked, it can be navigated with arrow buttons (similar to equipment menu)
- the abbreviation for Training Yard was changed to Yard

__Combat Systems__
- reduced the initiative penalty for changing your starting distance by 40%
- the combat log now indicates when a weakness or resistance is targeted
- increased the maximum display of the combat log before it needs to be expanded (hopefully won't break anything?)
- POISON and BURN should no longer apply damage to defeated enemies

__Equipment__
- in preparation for new classes, some physical weapons now also have small amounts of MAG:
- - Katana
- - Scythe
- - Bolas
- - Longbow
- - Pistol Crossbow

__Enemies__
- attempted to fix a bug that prevents enemies from choosing actions on their turns, soft-locking the dungeon

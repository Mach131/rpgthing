alchefist
	ranger; queues up to 2 effects that activate on next basic attack, combination causes different things
		3 from first skill, 2 more from second  -> 5 singles/duplicates + 10 combos
		single/duplicates cause elemental attacks; combos are based on some property of the second choice
			e.g. last 2 reagents might be oriented towards party buffs; maybe some access to healing
		duplicate powers might be influenced by mag
		increased MP cost for using the same reagent too many times in a row?
